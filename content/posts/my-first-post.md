Hello! I am Ishan! I am a student and I love tech. This is my off topic blog. I primarily write at [hashnode](https://noobscience.hashnode.dev) but I also wanted a off topic blog where I could write some cool stuff. But before you get into reading my blog, I want you to remember one very important thing

> All my opinions are mine and mine only

I always wanted to write blog articles and this is one way to be more in control over what I write. This site has no google analytics and uses minimal bootstrap and other javascript frameworks.

Maintaining and creating a blog site through pure HTML is quite time taking, so I turned to hugo and customized a well designed theme called [papermod]() to my liking and designed this cool and awesome site. I am sorry this site is not in dark mode .

```python
print("Hello World")
```
